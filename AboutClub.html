Values
Mustang Sports Club aspires to be an outstanding educational-athletic organization that provides a high-quality experience to every athlete. A high-quality experience is one in which every athlete:
<p>
<li>
Is coached using the principles of Positive Coaching
<li>Has fun playing the game</li>
<li>Feels like an important part of the team regardless of performance</li>
<li>Learns "life lessons" that have value beyond the playing field</li>
<li>Learns the skills, tactics and strategies of the game and improves as the athlete is exposed to age and skill appropriate competition</li>
</p>
</li>
<p>
We recognize that the coach is the one who most directly makes this all possible. It is our goal to provide every coach with tools to be successful as a Positive Coach. We are committed to creating a constructive culture in which coaches, parents, fans, officials and athletes work together to achieve our mission.

MSC and its coaches will adopt many of the values espoused by the Positive Coaching Alliance, which are centered around three core roles for a coach:

Redefine winning - Winning thru mastery instead of the scoreboard
Fill the Emotional Tank - Positive motivation instead of fear, intimidation or shame
Honor the Game - Know the Rules, Respect Opponents and Officials, Commit and Encourage your Team, Respect yourself.

                <h2>  General Guidelines for Team Formation:</h2>
            <p>Players will be placed on a team based on their registration number (First-Come-First-Served (FCFS.)) Player registration will be open without prejudice to all youth eligible to play in the sport. <p>
    <li>
        Returning players are given priority during registration through an Early-Registration Period. 
    <li>Once an early-registration period expires, new players and returning players will be added in order by registration number (on a FCFS basis)</li>
    <li>Once a team is formed, coaches have the discretion to move players between teams if they feel his or her skill levels deem it to be appropriate, and there is another team that better meets the players needs</li>
    <li>Every effort will be made to keep players together on the same team as they grow and progress through the program. As players age and competition increases players may be moved between teams if the coaches feel it is in the player and teams best interest. This will be the exception and not the norm, and will be based on skill level and player safety.</li>
    <li>Older Teams (5th grade or higher) that are playing in the most competitive divisions may utilize a evaluation format for team selection.</li>
