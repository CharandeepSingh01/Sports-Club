<li>Fun</li>
<li>Volleyball skills and development of mindset</li>
<li>Sportsmanship</li>
<li>Teamwork while playing volleyball</li>
<li>Captainship</li>
<li>Age & skill appropriate competition in the volleyball</li>
<p>
The program is directed by a board of parent volunteers, and is composed primarily of Colorado Academy students, as well as friends and peers from the community.

                <h2>  General Guidelines for Team Formation:</h2>
            <p>Players will be placed on a team based on their registration number (First-Come-First-Served (FCFS.)) Player registration will be open without prejudice to all youth eligible to play in the sport. <p>
    <li>
        Returning players are given priority during registration through an Early-Registration Period. 
    <li>Once an early-registration period expires, new players and returning players will be added in order by registration number (on a FCFS basis)</li>
    <li>Once a team is formed, coaches have the discretion to move players between teams if they feel his or her skill levels deem it to be appropriate, and there is another team that better meets the players needs</li>
    <li>Every effort will be made to keep players together on the same team as they grow and progress through the program. As players age and competition increases players may be moved between teams if the coaches feel it is in the player and teams best interest. This will be the exception and not the norm, and will be based on skill level and player safety.</li>
    <li>Older Teams (5th grade or higher) that are playing in the most competitive divisions may utilize a evaluation format for team selection.</li>
